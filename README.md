## What to Expect

When the Quiz is loaded:
- The user will be greeted with a "start" button and a short introduction that outlines how the code operates.
- Once "start" is clicked, the user is presented with a question and 4 answer choices.
- If the user selects the correct option, 10 points are added to their score.
- If the user selects the incorrect option, 10 seconds are deducted from the time limit.
- If the time runs out, a prompt is given to the user stating that they are out of time and they are re-directed to enter their initials to record their score.
- If the user answers all of the questions, the user is then promped to enter their initials to record their score.

## Lessons Learned

This project really dives in to how complex and integrated JavaScript can be. From creating elements within the script to logging information using JSON, this really helped expand my knowledge of the language. I will admit, this was quite challenging.
